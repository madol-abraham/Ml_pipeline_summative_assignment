# SmartFlow - Intelligent Irrigation Prediction System

![SmartFlow Logo](static/images/logo.png) <!-- Add your logo if available -->

## Project Description

SmartFlow is a machine learning-powered irrigation prediction system that helps farmers optimize water usage by predicting when crops need irrigation. The system analyzes environmental factors like soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and crop characteristics to make accurate predictions.

Key Features:
- Machine learning model for irrigation prediction
- Web interface for single predictions
- Bulk data upload capability
- Model retraining functionality
- Performance analytics dashboard
- Dockerized deployment

# project overview

smartFlow is a machine learning classification model that utilizes a neural network to predict whether irrigation is needed based on various environmental factors.
The model is designed to assist farmers in optimizing water usage, improving crop yield, and conserving resources.It is an end-to-end solution which features retraining, prediction and visualisation.


# Features

# Binary Classification:  
Predicts whether irrigation is required (1) or not (0).

# Neural Network Model: 
Uses deep learning for accurate predictions.

# Optimized for Smart Agriculture: 
Specifically design to  automate irrigation decisions based on real-time inputs.

# Inputs and Features
The model takes the following environmental and soil conditions as input:

# Soil moisture
# Time
# Air Humidity
# Wind Speed (Km/h)
# Soil Type
# Temperature
# Crop Type
# Rainfall
